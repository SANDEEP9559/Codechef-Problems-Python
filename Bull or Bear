Problem
Chef is on his way to become the new big bull of the stock market but is a bit weak at calculating whether he made a profit or a loss on his deal.

Given that Chef bought the stock at value XX and sold it at value YY. Help him calculate whether he made a profit, loss, or was it a neutral deal.



Code:

T= int(input())
for i in range(T):
    X,Y= map(int,input().split())
    if Y>X:
        print("Profit")
    elif X==Y:
        print("Neutral")
    else:
        print("loss")
