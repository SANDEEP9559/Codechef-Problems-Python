Problem
Chef is given two integers AA and CC such that A \leq CAâ‰¤C.

Chef wants to find whether there exists any integer BB such that A, B,A,B, and CC are in arithmetic progression.



Code:


T=int(input())
for i in range(T):
    A,C=map(int,input().split())
    B=(A+C)//2
    if (B-A)==(C-B):
        print(B)
    else:
        print(-1)
